These sprites are switches that the player can stand in front and interact with them by pressing up.

Unlike a P-switch-styled or block switch (on/off switch), this is an always passable sprite that lack
additional side features that can be used besides triggering it (such as P-switch styled buttons that
can 1-frame-jump off like a platform and on-off switch's bounce sprite to kill or flip other
sprites). This makes it possible in some cases like a tight corridor that is 1-block high and you do
not want anything above or below that area and allow the player to optionally toggle the switch
without jumping or not forcing the player to activate it as they pass through it.

Comes with 2 versions:
 -A wall button. A 1 tile high 8x8 button that is suitable to be placed on a scenery (such as on a
  layer 1 "background" wall)
 -A pedestal button that is mounted on a floor.
